# IP3G 
Keras implementation of "Intelligent Phenotype-Detection and Gene Expression Profile Generation with Generative Adversarial Networks"

## Dataset :
TCGA  and GTEx datasets are available in this repository : https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/

Other datasets on this site are also compatible with our code.

use the "download data.ipynb" to download data.

## Gene expression to Image:
To convert gene expression profiles to images with size 128x128, use "preprocessing.ipynb"

## Training IP3G
You can use "new model.ipynb" to train IP3G model
